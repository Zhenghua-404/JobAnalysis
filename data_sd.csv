About Legible
Come join us on our mission to empower and connect authors and readers through open access to a global reading and publishing platform. Legible is making books beautiful and accessible.
At Legible, we're transforming the world of stories; not just by creating a new and beautiful eBook platform to experience, but by making stories truly accessible. That means being available to everyone, everywhere, on any device, as well as working with assistive technologies, and making sure local and meaningful stories aren't buried by search bias. Surrounding that, we're going to be creating fantastic new ways for authors and readers to connect, with features to delight publishers big and tiny alike.
To make that magic happen takes amazing people. Sometimes that comes in the form of someone with untapped potential who needs to be given a shot, who wants a place where they can be heard and engaged, and sometimes amazing people come in the form of those seeking to quietly lead by example, sharing wisdom and wanting to mentor others.
We believe in the value of having a diverse team. Different backgrounds, upbringings, lifestyles, and perspectives make us stronger, wiser, and more capable. If you're looking for somewhere that wants you for the awesome person you are, and not just what you can do, we just might be the place for you.
Our Community Values: Accessibility, Sustainability, Beauty, and Integrity
Why Legible?
Legible is a startup with a heart - a company that values equity and diversity at its very core; It is a place to grow and experience different areas of the business. We are a small but mighty team, who are just turning the page on a new and exciting chapter of growth.
We offer:
An inclusive working environment - anyone and everyone is welcome at Legible
A flexible working schedule
Great paid time off package, including a paid winter break
A comprehensive benefits package
A multitude of avenues for career growth and change
An open-door policy - you can approach any member of leadership with confidence
Community Values - We work together as a team to better our local and global communities. We are invested in making a positive difference in the world.
“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.” - Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About Race
At Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.
Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.
How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis. One look at Legible.com will show how committed we are to diversity and inclusivity. We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrates, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs.
A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse. Miranda replied, ""That's just what happens when you go looking for the very best people!"" At Legible, we couldn't agree more!
Legible recognizes the right for human beings to self-identify. You are valued, safe, and supported.
To be considered for this position, you must be eligible to work in Canada and pass background checks

Surrounding that, we’re going to be creating fantastic new ways for authors and readers to connect, with features to delight publishers big and tiny alike.To make that magic happen takes amazing people. Sometimes that comes in the form of someone with untapped potential who needs to be given a shot, who wants a place where they can be heard and engaged, and sometimes amazing people come in the form of those seeking to quietly lead by example, sharing wisdom and wanting to mentor others.We believe in the value of having a diverse team.

We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.” - Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About RaceAt Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different?

General Dynamics Mission Systems-Canada is currently hiring for a Junior Software Developer in Ottawa, ON for our Vetronics team. As a Junior Software Developer, you wont require extensive design experience, that is developed over time. As long as you are comfortable in Linux and with C, then the main qualification is a strong ability to learn independently. Our team's software runs close to the hardware. We measure our boot time in milliseconds.
This role will be a combination of working remotely and onsite at our Ottawa office. We have a number of measures in place for onsite working – our top priority remains the health and safety of our colleagues.
Job Description:

On our software team there is no huge Java VM or Apache web server backend framework running our code, and there’s no Cloud. We make our own circuit cards, and on some there is an embedded Linux kernel, on others a thin embedded operating system, and on others there is no operating system at all. We write code for ARM processors and microprocessors. Our code makes the circuit boards work. Think: code that's written for an Odroid, Arduino or Raspberry Pi, but taken to the next level.
Although the larger team remains together, the programs are fast paced and sub-teams are continually formed – a typical software development cycle is measured in weeks, maybe months, never years, so there’s always a new challenge and always something to learn.
Multi-task, regularly switch contexts, and prioritize responsibilities
Work cooperatively within a small development team to take on new tasks
Perform detailed design, implementation, and unit testing activities in order to complete development tasks
Integrate software onto a combination of COTS dev kits and in-house designed hardware platforms

Holding a Bachelor’s degree program in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, or Computer Science
Able to persist through a learning curve

Exposure to developing embedded software for devices and computers
Exposure to configuring TCP/IP LANs, basic understanding of subnet masks and routing
Exposure to embedded micro-controllers and JTAG programmers

Company Overview:

General Dynamics Mission Systems engineers a diverse portfolio of high technology solutions, products and services that enable customers to successfully execute missions across all domains of operation.

A Thinking Ape builds communities through mobile games with emergent social play and original IP. We released our first game in 2009 and have been profitable and growing every year since. We are a bottom-up driven company with small teams that have a big focus on ownership and data driven decision making. Our portfolio of games are growing. We are scaling our infrastructure and entering new markets to capitalize on this growth and bring our games to more players.

The job

As a Software Development Engineer Co-op, you will be helping build our live mobile games, including Kingdoms of Heckfire, Party in my Dorm, and Kingdoms at War, as well as the tools and infrastructure needed to run these massively multiplayer online experiences. You will work closely with artists and designers to grow our games from the population of a city to the population of an entire country. You will design services used by a large number of concurrent users, and implement scalable, reliable and maintainable technologies for both client and server. You will have a major impact on the end product, and will be involved in every aspect of its development. Millions of people will use what you create.

What you will do

You will be responsible for implementing features, systems, and tools for our games in live operation. The game backends are built with a Django + MySQL server architecture, while the frontend clients are built using Unity or native iOS/Android depending on the product. You will also:

Build entire features from front-end client code to back-end server support. Many of our engineers are full stack!
Become involved in every aspect of product development, from design to implementation to playtests to metrics analysis.
Construct systems that let everyone at the company deploy to our distributed backend without worry.
Create tools to automate and optimize processes across disciplines. These might be adding additional player management tools for our community team, data pipeline optimizations for our game designers, or even content pipelines for our art team.

Who we are looking for

You are a tech generalist, a full stack engineer with the desire to work on both client and server side implementations of entire features.
Strong understanding of object-oriented design, data structures and algorithms.
You communicate your thoughts and ideas clearly in code and in writing
You have an interest in and play mobile gaming products.

Past co-ops have worked on..

Guild management improvements like the ability to invite people, open clubs that players can join without approval, better club search, and other tools to keep our most active players engaged.
Implemented a scalable group leaderboard event system full stack. The system guarantees consistency and availability while dozens of players try to contribute progress to their group frequently.
Revamped data deploy tool to enable multiple game designers to work simultaneously.
Setup metrics tracking and funnel analysis and experimented with different UI polishes to improve retention.
Worked on upgrading our data pipeline: processing data and creating different data representations and visualizations to help ATA to make marketing and product decisions.
Revamped the realm map overview to include real time positions of ongoing marches, key locations on the map and user bookmarked pins!
Implemented the entire stack for our Second Builder subscription purchase, which included interfacing with both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, as well as client support.
Optimized particle systems in-game to significantly reduce peak memory usage.
Developed leaderboard-assigned classes for Shrines to grant players additional perks.

Remote first

We have committed to a remote first approach with access to in-person collaboration spaces in Vancouver. This means our roles are currently open to candidates who can work in Canada between the core hours of 11am - 4pm PST.

While everyone on our team is different to thrive here you should ...

Be self motivated, take pride in your work and enjoy huge amounts of ownership
Set aside your ego and have wonderful arguments with your coworkers in order to create something better than any one person could individually
Challenge your own assumptions and use data to make decisions whenever possible
Be passionate about teaching others what you know and continuing your own growth every day
Not be afraid to fail–you experiment and learn from your mistakes

What's in it for you

At ATA you're offered a flexible, safe, inclusive environment in which you have the autonomy to do your best work, surrounded by a strong team and with the encouragement of supportive leadership that doesn't just care what you're doing, but how you're doing. You're trusted, respected, listened to, cared for and valued. You take on thought-provoking projects and tackle fun problems alongside people who are equally invested in making meaningful contributions and seeing new ideas come to life. You know how your work aligns with the company's goals. Your career is given the space and resources to progress. You accomplish things that make you proud. You are compensated competitively, your health and wellbeing are top priorities and you enjoy plenty of perks. You build communities, take ownership, have wonderful arguments, let the best ideas win and keep growing. You don't just work for ATA, you are an integral part of ATA.

Applied scientists and software engineers in the Turing team work together to push the boundaries of large-scale deep learning models on Turing’s world class distributed training infrastructure.
The team works on projects across the entire deep learning life-cycle. This includes deep learning models for language representation, language generation, image representations, and reinforcement learning which are then leveraged for down stream tasks for Bing, Office, Xbox, and more. Our Turing NLG (natural language generation) model is 17 billion parameters and powers many generative models within Microsoft. The Turing ULR (universal language representation) model is currently the top model on the XTREME leaderboard. Additionally, we work on large-scale distributed training, improving training performance, and run-time optimized inference allowing us to utilize the power of large models in production scenarios with tight latency constraints. The scenarios our models power reach hundreds of millions of users every month and span across natural language processing, computer vision, video processing, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems.
In addition to ensuring that Microsoft is pushing the state-of-the-art large-scale models, the Turing team also works on improving experiences across Microsoft’s products and services by working on high value scenarios. The Turing team has shipped capabilities across all of many Microsoft scenarios including AutoSuggest, Microsoft Word’s new find feature, quick reply on Outlook, Smart Compose features in Word, image enhancement models, recommendations, as well as many other features across Office, Bing, and Xbox. Additionally, we are working on a few entirely new experiences such as semantic search for enterprise and knowledge management (aka Cortex) for our SharePoint customers.
As a Software Engineer in the Turing team, you will leverage your skills and experience to help build tools, frameworks and customer facing UI for our state-of-the-art deep learning models that power impactful features and are used by 100s of millions of people. You will work closely with applied scientists and engineers on building both backend tools to improve our models, and front end experiences built on top of those models do delight our customers. You will be responsible for building scalable performant, and beautiful UIs. This involves defining the architecture, implementation, validating everything is tested and robust and defining processes to improve our best practices.
Do you want to work with a world class team of engineers and applied scientists? Would you like to be a part of a diverse, passionate, open-cultured, high visibility team with ambitious goals and a track record for delivering high value impact across the company? We are hiring at all levels from entry level to Principal.

DevOps - Software Developer (remote),"ZensuranceToronto, ONRemote","Zensurance is a fast growing start-up turned “scale-up”, insure-tech company that is disrupting the insurance market. Zensurance is focused on building a market leading insurance platform that helps small and medium sized businesses manage their business risks. This task requires us to engineer from scratch, a customer-centric organization and product. We are boldly going where no insurance broker has gone before!
Do you enjoy coding, tooling, and data security? Are you always at the cutting edge of the best infosec practices? Do you love learning new things and see every challenge as an opportunity? Do you want to gain experience in spinning up the tightest and most rigorous security testing in cicd systems and are ready for your next challenge? Read on…

Zensurance is looking to add its first DevSecOps Developer to join a new and growing DevOps team (what we call our Platform Team). Your two major areas of responsibility will be infosec operations and security tooling. If you are looking for a way to have a huge impact on the lives of Canadian entrepreneurs, this is the place to do it.

The ""no-fluff"" benefits of joining Zensurance

Complex Challenges: In its current state, the insurance industry can make buying insurance unnecessarily complex. Your challenge would be to take that complexity and make it easy for small and mid-sized businesses to understand and select the right coverage using your development experience in a MERN stack environment.

Code is for Humans: Not only are you coding for our users, but you are also coding for other teams and future teams. You will join an environment that believes in strong documentation, commenting on the code, and making things as straightforward as possible without sacrificing code quality and scalability (cutting the right corners).

Everyone Has a Voice: Your opinion matters; but so does the opinion of anyone else that has insight and data that can add value and strength to our design and code. We strongly believe that you should have strong opinions, but they should be loosely held and open to change when presented with new information.

Passionate People: You will join an environment where people love to solve problems (small and complex), are excited to share what they have learned, and who push themselves to make the most of their workweek while ACTUALLY maintaining work-life balance.

Software Developer,"Genesys296 reviewsMarkham, ONTemporarily remote","Software Developer

Are you interested in working on modern web apps? Do you want to meaningfully contribute to something and not just write code? What about getting to pick your own tools (and even write them when necessary)? If so, keep reading…

What this role is:
You will be working on web applications built mostly in Vue. You will continuously deploy code without downtime. You’ll build new features with the help of embedded QA and UX designers. You will help own the web architecture, build tools, client API handlers, unit test frameworks, and everything else that comes together to deploy a modern web application.

What this role is not:
You will not be a simple programmer who is given detailed specifications and forced to write code that others want you to. You will be given mockups, and you will have to work within the existing architectures to some degree, but you will have freedom to design and engineer web applications. We want real software engineers here – people who care about doing it right the first time.

What you will bring to the table:

You should be a lifelong learner who is capable of working well within a team. You should be a strong problem solver who is capable of debugging complex customer situations one day and building greenfield UIs the next. You should be detail-oriented, be smart, and get things done. These things are much more important than being an “expert” in some toolset we happen to use today.

Some details about what you will do day to day:
Build, debug, test web applications written in TypeScript
Build shared controls to be used within our team and others
Understand our APIs to use them efficiently in our web applications

We call it Payroll 2.0.It used to be that the payroll department needed time to make sure everybody’s pay was accurate, then to send money to their payroll provider who could then do all the payroll calculations and deposit your pay to your bank account. But as consumer behaviour has shifted with the growth of everything being available on demand, payroll has failed to adapt with our expectations. More and more, people have bills that are due on a regular basis and with the impact of COVID-19, need to pay in advance for items they are ordering online.Meanwhile, businesses are spending billions of dollars a year on administering payroll, from checking timesheets, calculating hours, entering duplicate data between multiple software programs and double checking everything to ensure there are no mistakes. Even after spending all this time and money to get it right, businesses pay billions more in penalties for errors and omissions caused in their ‘meticulous’ payroll processes.Rivvi is rethinking payroll with our perspective on a payroll platform that automates the entire payroll process and ensures 100% compliance. In addition, we enable employees to choose their own payday, allowing them to align their pay with their own personal circumstances and not being forced to access short term payday loan services.

Software Developer,SherWeb54 reviewsRemoteRemote,"Position: Full-time, permanent position.
Start date: As soon as possible.


Here’s what we do and why we do it.

Simply put, we will work together to simplify businesses’ IT with cloud technology so they can focus on what really matters, making people’s lives better. Discover how we do that here: www.sherweb.com/about/

How do we do it?

Our team structure embraces agile and DevOps values, by product, with a strong bond that unites us to share and unify our practices. To achieve this, we have even created our own DevEx team which has only one mission: Help development teams to be even more efficient in order to deliver value in a sustainable way!

We take pride in what we deliver as a product and our customers make us feel it! It’s because of the teamwork, passion and customer focus (basically Sherweb values!) that we get there!

Our management team, aware of the 2021 reality, supports us in our organization, listens to us and offers us modern and innovative evolution. Last one on the list: self-assignment of team members once a year!

Are you starting to feel the vibe? ;) Basically, we always try to improve, modernize, even if everything is not always perfect


Here's what we are looking for:

Good developers, team players, always eager to learn and improve their skills, who like well-structured and high-performance code, object oriented, and that excel in backend or frontend or both.

So if you want to work hard in a multidisciplinary product team, really be the “owner” of what you do, have fun with your colleagues (happy hours, online gaming nights, Friday beer), all in a flexible and respectful environment, well Sherweb is the place where you want to work, and for a long time!


Here's what we offer:

Flexible schedule (35 to 40 hours per week)
Flexible group insurance according to your needs, including a healthcare spending account and telemedicine
Advantageous savings plan (RRSP or TFSA) with Sherweb’s contribution
Annual vacations available from your first day
Paid training hours
Post-Covid remote work possible.


Here's the ideal background for this position:

Demonstrated experience (minimum 5 years) in developing Web applications, APIs and SaaS products
Knowledge and application of SOLID and DDD principles, as well as a strong orientation for clean code
Experience with the following technologies: .Net Core, .Net Framework, C#, Angular, EntityFramework, Nhibernate (or other frameworks), SQL Server, MongoDB, RabbitMQ
If your experience is in Java and you are interested in learning C#, we have an internal training team to support you
Bilingualism (French and English)
College or University diploma in computer science.

If you have these skills, you will fit right in with us:

Communication skills – Why? Because you will be expected to explain and vulgarize concepts by adapting the style and content of your messages to your audience (whether it’s internal client, external clients or your teammates).
Organization and resourcefulness – Why? Because we don’t believe in micromanagement. You will need to figure out solutions on your own by using your skills, your knowledge and any relevant information you can get your hands on.
Problem-solving skills – Why? Because when you will face a problem, you will first analyze the information before identifying the possible causes. You will then explore and implement the most efficient and logical solutions.
Adaptability – Why? Because our industry evolves constantly. You will have to adjust your thinking and methods to better suit new or unplanned situations (whether it’s for your daily tasks or your work environment).

Here’s what you can expect from us.

Shortcutting your journey to your aspirations is possible when you surround yourself early on with knowledgeable and genuine people. We will put you in charge of important responsibilities from the beginning so that you can build your professional reputation. We will also help you quickly identify your strengths to build a strong foundation for your potential.

This is our team philosophy.

Humans were built to create. What unites our team is the sense of purpose we get from building the platforms that make technology possible and accessible for people. That's who we are, not just what we do. If you share this philosophy, you might just be one of us. Send us your resume to tell us your story.

Sherweb is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving an environment of diversity and inclusion where everybody can feel welcome. We're looking to grow our teams with people who share our passion for innovation and creating the best experience for our employees, partners and clients.

We are a well-funded, hyper-growth, scale-up looking for an experienced Senior Software Engineer. If you've ever dreamed of working with a top tier technology company scale-up, on leading edge technologies, backed by the very best venture capitalists in the world, then this is your chance.

Some details about MobSquad:

MobSquad solves the significant and growing technology talent shortage faced by US-based start-ups and scale-ups by enabling its clients to quickly have a turnkey ""virtual"" Canadian subsidiary. MobSquad ensures technology professionals with US work visa challenges remain working with their current company, but nearshore from Canada. This is accomplished via MobSquad's unique partnership with the Canadian Government, enabling work visas to be issued for technology professionals and their respective families within four to six weeks, and Canadian permanent residency within six to eight months. Additionally, MobSquad has unfettered access to top-tier global technology talent which it relocates to Canada and pairs with American as well as Canadian clients on an exclusive, long-term basis, helping firms not only retain their existing world-class technology talent base, but grow it substantially.
We're a Certified B corporation, and have made numerous contributions to charitable organizations, as well as a financial commitment to the Upside Foundation. We believe we are playing a key role in enhancing Canada's innovation economy, and have received financial support from the Government of Canada, Province of Alberta, Province of Nova Scotia, and City of Calgary, to support this ambition.
For our workplace culture, we were recognized as the 3rd best place to work in Canada (for a small company) in 2020, as well as recognized specifically for being one of the best workplaces nationally for: inclusion; mental wellness; giving back; youth; and technology. We were also recognized as one of the best start-ups to work for across Canada.
For our innovative business model, we have been featured in numerous media outlets including: Asian Pacific Post; BetaKit; Bloomberg; CBC; Global News; Gothamist; International Business Times; MIT Technology Review; Nearshore Americas; Nikkei Asian Review; NPR; The Economic Times of India; The Financial Times; The Globe and Mail; The Information; The New York Times; and The Washington Post.
Harvard Business School published a case study on MobSquad last fall, and Harvard Business Review featured us multiple times in an article that appeared on the cover of their November/December 2020 edition.

An individual who knows that good enough isn’t good enough.

Building front-ends for headless systems, using React or other JS frontends.

Paid Overtime for all roles...including salary positions: What? What?! Yep you heard right. We pay for all approved OT...not that we want everyone working so hard, but with the natural ebb and flow of our industry sometimes it's needed to blast out the OT in order to keep our heads above water. We find this little pay cheque nugget is a nice reward for the over timerz.
Slappies: Tougher to explain but once a month we get together and have a little ceremony, some food, a few brews - no altars or corporate chants involved.
Fun day: We aim to have fun every day; however, every year for a day we cram a bunch of fun on ourselves. Weee!
SPARC Events: Sometimes we have an in-house breakfast, team building events, (less corny than it sounds), competitions, or just a plain little reward for no reason. It's a little spark in our usually normal days. Warning, we make you wear costumes. Often.

 Who we are:

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and shuttles. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Calgary Transit, and San Diego County.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.


RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. At RideCo, we celebrate diversity, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our customers, our products, and our community. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Please let us know if you require accommodation during the recruitment process.",https://ca.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1d2f1ca163c3d723&fccid=e04c335ad3aed20a&vjs=3

Who we need
We're adding a Software Developer to our innovative, solution-oriented, dedicated team. You will play a critical role, taking our platform to the next level as you work on all aspects of the software and all phases of the SDLC. You will have the opportunity to work independently, moving ideas from concept to functional design to development, implementation, and deployment. In addition, you will gain exposure to our Agile practices and cloud-based software development operations as part of a small team working across the Ocean platform: Android tablet to web UI to server and database. What you do here will be limited only by your imagination and drive to make it a reality.
Who you are
You are passionate about technology with purpose and making an impact. You love working in a dynamic and collaborative environment. Whether you are used to the hustle of a startup or the processes of a bigger organization, you come with a passion for solving complex problems with innovative technology and the drive to make an impact.
You have expertise with a wide range of tools from end-to-end of the SDLC across the full stack. You have an appreciation for a diversity of thought and experience and enjoy guiding the work of junior team members and fostering working relationships. Whatever it is, you do it with dedication, and you constantly challenge yourself and absorb new information.
Our tech stack
Web development (Vue.js and JavaScript/HTML)
Server development (Java/Spring/MongoDB/JEE)
Cloud SaaS operations (Linux/Tomcat/Apache Web)
Cryptography (AES and RSA)
Android tablet development (Java/Android SDK)
What's in it for you
Impact and influence. You will play an essential role in bringing our mission to light. You want to make a difference in how Canadians experience the healthcare system and empower both patients and physicians with the technology they need to streamline access to information.
A place to grow your career and your skills. You will be a key player at a company that is at an exciting point, rapidly moving past the scale-up stage while retaining the best of our startup values: responsiveness, work-life balance, hands-on innovation opportunities, and excitement. We are looking for dedicated, honourable individuals who want to commit to our work, take our offerings to the next level and the one beyond that, and help us grow as a company. In turn, as we continue to scale, we will take you on the journey with us, creating opportunities for professional development, recognition, and growth.
How you will make an impact
Build. You will build new features and functionality that delivers an innovative, scalable and reliable product solution that our team is proud to declare ownership of. You will play a role in contributing to the architecture and framework of our solution.
Be Agile. You will engage in agile software development while adhering to reasonably-paced project deadlines. We pride ourselves on setting reasonable expectations in order to prioritize both the quality of our product - and of your life. You will translate functionalities into development stories and self-manage completion. You will assist and guide the work of junior developers and co-op students.
Prioritize quality. As a member of the development team, you will participate in peer code reviews, and test automation, ensuring each release meets our high quality standards. You will propose optimizations for enhancing the reliability and speed of our platform.
Research and analyze. You will actively participate in architecture discussions, presenting well-thought-out ideas and evidence for choosing a particular tool, process, or method.
What you bring
The experience. You bring 4+ years of experience developing B2B product software and a willingness to dive in to figure out the best approaches quickly, whether they are based on technology or a human-centred approach. You have existing skills that you are very proud of and a resourcefulness that leads you to build new skills to grow your expertise, including production cloud server operations.
The collaborative approach. You can build trusting relations and efficiently work across teams, both in-person and remote. You are quick to adapt when priorities shift and take feedback well. You are comfortable with ambiguity and are willing to figure things out when no clear, defined path or process is outlined.
The initiative. You are a critical thinker who can creatively solve problems, and you continuously pursue knowledge. You are inspired by a fast-paced environment and can rise to the challenge of competing priorities.
The flexibility. You are happy working from home but are open to sometimes working on-site at our head office in Toronto as part of a flexible hybrid model planned for 2022.
Our culture, our team
We’re a scaling company, past the startup stage and on the cusp of the next stage. We are incredibly passionate about our ability to make a difference in the lives of Canadians through our technology and we firmly believe that we can do our best work with realistic deadlines and transparent communication about where we are and what’s next for us as an organization. We understand the time it takes to revolutionize a paper-based industry and develop and release high-quality resilient, compliant, and responsive technology that is easy to use so we ensure that pace is factored into our projects and deliverables across the organization.
Our focus is your growth and professional satisfaction, resulting in clear opportunities to help us scale and be better through your ideas, and the chance to be part of projects, and try new things. We are dedicated to our team, and we strongly believe that family comes first. To that end, we strive to find opportunities to support balance in the workplace and between work and home. As part of this, we have flexible hours, lunch socials (virtual for now but some physically-distanced small gatherings too), and meeting-free Friday afternoons.
Everyone here is deeply committed to what we can do - and the potential we have to do more. As a result, we provide an opportunity for CognisantCauses, our name for passion projects in healthcare where no funding is available and a little technical expertise and time is needed to make a big difference. It’s a way to give back and to add further meaning to what you do here.
A note on values
We value ethical behaviour above all else. We care about each other and we respect each other as professionals and people. We treat our customers with respect and keep our word, even if it hurts. We own our mistakes. We strive for honesty and integrity every day in every situation. We look for people who share these values.

Software Developer,"Dejero11 reviewsWaterloo, ON","It all started on a bus.
Through his experience providing mobile connectivity for election campaigns, Dejero founder Bogdan Frusina witnessed first-hand the challenges that journalists faced reporting live from the campaign trail. His goal became developing and commercializing a live video broadcast solution. In November 2009, that vision came to life. Dejero enabled the world’s first live transmission of the torch relay across Canada for the Vancouver Winter Olympics.
Since then, we have expanded to aggregate diverse connectivity paths including LTE and 5G cellular, satellite, and broadband to deliver enhanced reliability, expanded coverage, and greater bandwidth using our patented (and award winning!)

Here’s why you should join the Dejero team:

If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that work-life balance is extremely important. As we find our new normal, our employees are able to choose their preferred work environment; home, work or hybrid.
We are home to an award-winning culture, products, and teams. This year, Great Place to Work ranked us 5th Best Place to Work in Canada! We have also won two Emmys for our Smart Blending Technology.
Giving back is a key pillar of our culture. Last year, Dejero and its employees contributed thousands of dollars to 12 local and international charities. In addition, through Dejero’s Day of Doing Great Things and employees’ annual paid volunteer day, we encourage our team to go out into the community and volunteer for local organizations.
You have a say in the projects you get to work on based on your passions and interests. Our team attacks technical challenges together and all code is peer reviewed to leverage the strengths that each team member brings to the table.

Founded in 2011, Mappedin provides indoor maps for world-class venues, enabling consumers to find what they’re looking for with speed and ease.
Our technology powers over 600M square feet of indoor space across more than 700 venues in more than 30 different countries.
Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.
Who you are and what you’ll do
You’re a developer that wants to build great web applications with React used by millions of people and aren’t put off by the opportunity to write Node.js backend code from time to time. What you really care about is clean code that works, covered with high quality automated tests.
Your team is responsible for both maintaining Mappedin’s current Indoor Mapping Software as well as building our next generation Editor product. That means you should already have or are interested in obtaining experience in:
Front End Application Development using React
TypeScript
Test Driven Development
Map rendering frameworks such as deck.gl, Leaflet, or MapBox GL JS
What are some challenges?
Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.
Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.
There is a lot of discovery work involved as we frequently do things that are ahead of current technology. We also encounter tough problems that require a lot of math. It’s not a requirement for this role, but if you enjoy solving interesting geometry problems, we’d love to have your input.
Behind the scenes
We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.
We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We offer a flexible working environment, have a generous vacation policy, and we all work together to help you produce your best work. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

What are some challenges?
Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.
Building the core tools that Mappedin and our customers rely on to make and maintain over 600 million square feet of premium indoor space worldwide is no easy task. We need our tools to be both easy to get started with while not holding back power users.
Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.
There is a lot of discovery work involved as we frequently do things that are ahead of current technology. We also encounter tough problems that require a lot of math. It’s not a requirement for this role, but if you enjoy solving interesting geometry problems, we’d love to have your input.
Behind the scenes
We recognize developers are most effective when they’re allowed to get into the zone; therefore, we run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.
We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We offer a flexible working environment, have a generous vacation policy, and we all work together to help you produce your best work. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

Senior Software Developer,SherWeb54 reviewsRemoteRemote,"Position: Full-time, permanent position.
Start date: As soon as possible.


Here’s what we do and why we do it.

Simply put, we will work together to simplify businesses’ IT with cloud technology so they can focus on what really matters, making people’s lives better. Discover how we do that here: www.sherweb.com/about/

How do we do it?

Our team structure embraces agile and DevOps values, by product, with a strong bond that unites us to share and unify our practices. To achieve this, we have even created our own DevEx team which has only one mission: Help development teams to be even more efficient in order to deliver value in a sustainable way!

We take pride in what we deliver as a product and our customers make us feel it! It’s because of the teamwork, passion and customer focus (basically Sherweb values!) that we get there!

Our management team, aware of the 2021 reality, supports us in our organization, listens to us and offers us modern and innovative evolution. Last one on the list: self-assignment of team members once a year!

Are you starting to feel the vibe? ;) Basically, we always try to improve, modernize, even if everything is not always perfect


Here's what we are looking for:

Good developers, team players, always eager to learn and improve their skills, who like well-structured and high-performance code, object oriented, and that excel in backend or frontend or both.

So if you want to work hard in a multidisciplinary product team, really be the “owner” of what you do, have fun with your colleagues (happy hours, online gaming nights, Friday beer), all in a flexible and respectful environment, well Sherweb is the place where you want to work, and for a long time!


Here's what we offer:

Flexible schedule (35 to 40 hours per week)
Flexible group insurance according to your needs, including a healthcare spending account and telemedicine
Advantageous savings plan (RRSP or TFSA) with Sherweb’s contribution
Annual vacations available from your first day
Paid training hours
Post-Covid remote work possible.


Here's the ideal background for this position:

Demonstrated experience in developing Web applications, APIs and SaaS products
Knowledge and application of SOLID and DDD principles, as well as a strong orientation for clean code
Experience with the following technologies: .Net Core, .Net Framework, C#, Angular, EntityFramework, Nhibernate (or other frameworks), SQL Server, MongoDB, RabbitMQ
If your experience is in Java and you are interested in learning C#, we have an internal training team to support you
Bilingualism (French and English)
College or University diploma in computer science.

If you have these skills, you will fit right in with us:

Communication skills – Why? Because you will be expected to explain and vulgarize concepts by adapting the style and content of your messages to your audience (whether it’s internal client, external clients or your teammates).
Organization and resourcefulness – Why? Because we don’t believe in micromanagement. You will need to figure out solutions on your own by using your skills, your knowledge and any relevant information you can get your hands on.
Problem-solving skills – Why? Because when you will face a problem, you will first analyze the information before identifying the possible causes. You will then explore and implement the most efficient and logical solutions.
Adaptability – Why? Because our industry evolves constantly. You will have to adjust your thinking and methods to better suit new or unplanned situations (whether it’s for your daily tasks or your work environment).

Here’s what you can expect from us.

Shortcutting your journey to your aspirations is possible when you surround yourself early on with knowledgeable and genuine people. We will put you in charge of important responsibilities from the beginning so that you can build your professional reputation. We will also help you quickly identify your strengths to build a strong foundation for your potential.

This is our team philosophy.

Humans were built to create. What unites our team is the sense of purpose we get from building the platforms that make technology possible and accessible for people. That's who we are, not just what we do. If you share this philosophy, you might just be one of us. Send us your resume to tell us your story.

Sherweb is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving an environment of diversity and inclusion where everybody can feel welcome. We're looking to grow our teams with people who share our passion for innovation and creating the best experience for our employees, partners and clients.

Software Developer,"glasscanvasLangley, BCRemote","If you have to think twice about how Vim relates to shiny countertops and you’re willing to jump into a new technology even though it’s unchartered waters, we have been looking for you.
You value writing code that’s easy to reason more than being clever. You get excited about solving complex problems with simple, elegant solutions. You prioritize functional, scaleable logic made with the target user in mind. You are self-motivated and able to complete tasks on time, but know when and how to communicate early if deadlines or challenges will keep you from accomplishing your goals. You are a proactive self-starter, inspired when there is room for you to try new things and discover solutions for yourself.

Is that you? Let's talk!
Who is Glass Canvas?

A bit about us.
Our team started years ago with Jason Jensen and Pierre de Fleuriot who wanted to bring beauty and innovation back to how we communicate the Gospel. We became Glass Canvas, an agency just outside Vancouver, B.C., who works with the spirit-led to unlock ministry potential through marketing, strategy, branding, and digital tools.
Over the past few years, we've seen a need from our faith-based clients, specifically in the Catholic Church, who wanted to tell their story and communicate to their audience but didn't have the tools to do it well.
Our team had both the marketing, ministry, and technology experience so we began developing the Tilma product, a digital platform built for the diocese, parishes, and Catholic news sources, that would help them function seamlessly internally and reach their audience in a more impactful way. Today, we are a full product-focused company.
A Day in The Life Of a Developer

Here are some of your responsibilities:
Estimating and implementing web & mobile solutions including the interplay between the database, backend, and frontend technologies in a clean, robust way.
Writing automated tests in a pragmatic way - where it makes sense to.
Solving complex problems with simple, elegant solutions.
Always looking for innovative ways to improve our code.
Helping to plan, build, deploy, and manage new and existing systems, infrastructure, and features.
Monitoring health of underlying virtual infrastructure hardware and assisting in troubleshooting issues and finding resolutions.
You’ll be engineering the content network that a user will engage with at every step of their journey, and working the behind the scenes magic to make it a reality.
Here are a few things we are looking for:
We’re looking for a developer with the ability to work anywhere in the technical stack, taking time to deliver quality code. Your role is to stay aware of web development best-practices and performance considerations to build solutions based on data and testing.
We need you to be on top of your game. While we understand that it will take time to get used to being part of the team, we want you to be a proactive self-starter, who can handle ambiguity and uncertainty with minimal guidance.
We need you to operate with server-side frameworks such as Rails, NodeJS. Our team uses Ruby on Rails, so any Rails experience you may have is a definite plus.
Effective problem solving including being able to break down work/make tickets
We need you to be curious and willing to learn new technologies with the ability to absorb and retain information quickly. Strong interpersonal skills, keen attention to detail and the ability to effectively prioritize and execute tasks in a high-pressure environment wouldn't hurt either.
We’re also the praying kind, so spiritual conversations are commonplace. While we don’t require you to practice a certain kind of faith, most of our team members and our clients come from a spiritual background. So openness to spirituality and church culture would definitely be an asset.
You should have experience with:

Git and services like GitLab, Github
CSS preprocessors like SASS and PostCSS
REST/GraphQL APIs

Agile Development Experience
Server-side languages like Ruby
CRUD and prototyping frameworks like RoR or Laravel
Relational databases


Some other things you can expect at GC:

We are open to remote working from home (but value getting together to hash out solutions)
A fun, collaborative work environment
A lot of espresso…
Extended benefits for you and your spouse


CHALLENGE ACCEPTED?

Here’s what you need to do next:

If all this sounds good, we want to hear from you. We’d love to see your resume as well as a short note about what you think you are best in the world at (or would like to be). We’d also love to know how you heard about us and what makes you want to join our team.

Inception – Software Developer Job Description

INCEPTION – YOUR MODERN NEWSROOM

The world has changed. It’s faster paced, and we’re bombarded with more information than ever before. For news organizations to succeed they must adapt to the quickly evolving world of social media and find new ways to plan and organize their content.

News productions must also leverage new platforms, no longer is it acceptable to simply broadcast over the air. To reach the broadest audience and be successful, content needs to be produced for all mediums, including broadcast, the Web, and social media. Audiences need to be engaged in a way that was never possible until now.

We need you to become part of the winning team that makes all this possible.

We are a team currently transitioning into an agile workflow and believe in incremental development and continual improvement. We know we’re not perfect and as we embark on this journey, we expect to make mistakes, but also to learn from those mistakes and grow as a result to become stronger, faster, better.

Customer satisfaction is our highest priority, so we are highly customer focused. If that means jumping on a plane and flying half-way around the world to address an issue, then that’s what we’ll do. If that means sticking our heads into a lion’s mouth, well… we won’t do that, but you get the idea •.

We believe in technical excellence and want to create craftspeople as opposed to developers and testers. We think that following best practices, such as TDD, clean code, adhering to SOLID design principles, clean architecture, test automation, and high levels of collaboration among the team produces the most maintainable and extendable applications.

While we have individual specialties, we are all full stack developers. Some of the technologies we work with include React, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Jetty, Ajax, Java, Eclipse, OSGi, Struts, and Hibernate.

WE'RE GROWING FAST

That means we are always looking for better ways to adapt our work environment and processes to meet the high demands of our customers. Our roles morph, we volunteer for extra tasks, we all care a lot about helping to make good things happen. If you don't like change, you’re in the wrong place, but if you do, then you can be part of an incredible journey.

WHY WORK FOR US?

We can help you flourish. You will get to develop and deliver cutting edge technological solutions for the entertainment industry. You will be part of the Ross Video team working together to make that happen, and we find that a pretty energizing environment.

We value our people and listen to their feedback. We also offer great perks, flexible hours, free coffee and soft drinks (and a commercial espresso machine for when you need that extra jolt), team building events, BBQ's, and other fun activities. You'll also get to work on real-world projects that have a meaningful impact to our customers and are in use all over the world, every day.

Equity, Diversity & Inclusion
At Ross, we embrace diversity, and we want you to bring your authentic self to work. We are committed to building a team that includes a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. Inclusivity drives innovation and creativity, and that’s something we’re passionate about at Ross!

DevOps - Software Developer (remote),"ZensuranceToronto, ONRemote","Zensurance is a fast growing start-up turned “scale-up”, insure-tech company that is disrupting the insurance market. Zensurance is focused on building a market leading insurance platform that helps small and medium sized businesses manage their business risks. This task requires us to engineer from scratch, a customer-centric organization and product. We are boldly going where no insurance broker has gone before!
Do you enjoy coding, tooling, and data security? Are you always at the cutting edge of the best infosec practices? Do you love learning new things and see every challenge as an opportunity? Do you want to gain experience in spinning up the tightest and most rigorous security testing in cicd systems and are ready for your next challenge? Read on…

Zensurance is looking to add its first DevSecOps Developer to join a new and growing DevOps team (what we call our Platform Team).

The ""no-fluff"" benefits of joining Zensurance

Complex Challenges: In its current state, the insurance industry can make buying insurance unnecessarily complex. Your challenge would be to take that complexity and make it easy for small and mid-sized businesses to understand and select the right coverage using your development experience in a MERN stack environment.

Code is for Humans: Not only are you coding for our users, but you are also coding for other teams and future teams. You will join an environment that believes in strong documentation, commenting on the code, and making things as straightforward as possible without sacrificing code quality and scalability (cutting the right corners).

Everyone Has a Voice: Your opinion matters; but so does the opinion of anyone else that has insight and data that can add value and strength to our design and code. We strongly believe that you should have strong opinions, but they should be loosely held and open to change when presented with new information.

Passionate People: You will join an environment where people love to solve problems (small and complex), are excited to share what they have learned, and who push themselves to make the most of their workweek while ACTUALLY maintaining work-life balance.

I’ve never heard of PointClickCare. What do you do?

We’re a cloud-based software provider for the senior care market in North America. But we’re also the industry leaders in terms of growth potential and our expansion into new markets of Senior Care. We all know someone who has aging parents or grandparents. Our technology is helping to improve the quality of care for the additional 58 Million Seniors that will reside in North America over the next 16 years.

So what does a Software Developer at PointClickCare do?

You don’t just get stuck in the usual Enterprise Software world here. We work with Sensors, API’s, 3rd parties, mobile apps, hybrid apps, and other cool technologies for Full Stack Developers to work on. We operate in an Agile SW Development environment, and we’re continuing to invest heavily in R&D.

What does a typical day look like for a SW Developer?

The majority of your day would be spent working with a cross-functional team of developers, business analysts, and quality analysts to specify, design, develop, test, and implement software. They’re all great people to work with. Trust me.
You’d also spend some time in the design and development in all tiers of web application, including front and back end design, database design, and unit testing.
We’re huge on professional development, and so there’s always a training class, hackathon, or an internal course being offered.
Time permitting, debate Star Wars versus Star Trek.

Software Developer,"Contractor ComplianceToronto, ON","Job Description
As a Developer you will oversee the development of our SaaS application at Contractor Compliance.
You'll be reporting directly into our Director of Software Development to help drive our product roadmap as we continue to scale our business. Due to significant growth and interest from consumers and investors, we are looking to take our offering to the next level. We're looking for people to come in and make the most of this opportunity by helping us shape the future of our company. We have a vision, but no vision is complete without amazing ideas along the way.
Keep in mind, this is a 100% hands-on role and you will drive the development efforts and production code on a daily basis. This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to make their mark with the development of a great product, subsequently being a part of a rapidly scaling team.
About Us
At Contractor Compliance we believe in DIFFERENTIATION. We approach our industry differently, we treat our customers differently, and most importantly we treat our team differently.
Contractor Compliance is a SaaS solution provider that helps organizations simplify their contractor management process. Nobody wants to spend their days sifting through documents, managing spreadsheets and tracking down missing info from contractors - but more than 90% of the market is stuck in the past. With Contractor Compliance, we bring efficiencies to our customers that should have been a part of their day-to-day operations for years, and they can see it immediately.
Responsibilities
Contractor Compliance is built using Laravel (PHP) and has native clients for the web, iOS and Android. As such, we are looking for developers who:
Minimum of three (3) years experience with the following:
PHP / Laravel or Vue.js or iOS or Android.
Have experience building APIs.
Have experience building event driven applications (bonus points for using FaaS in AWS).
Practice Test-Driven-Development (or feel a little guilty when you don't).
Believes the quality of the application is THEIR responsibility, not someone in the ""QA"" department.
Are able to solve hard problems elegantly and securely.
Are not scared to reach up or down the stack.
Thrive in fast-paced startups that are moving towards Continuous Delivery practices.
Has empathy for customers & users.
Preference given to candidates with a Post-secondary degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience.
What's in it for You?
Alright, so why join Contractor Compliance? What really makes this opportunity different than anything else out there?
DEVELOPMENT. Development of our people is what gets our CEO up in the morning, and from the top down our organization prides ourselves in hiring best in class leaders to ensure our team-members can make the most of their careers (both personally and professionally). You will have direct access to this level of dedication to your craft from day 1.
IMPACT. We're a start-up (for now) but have plans for much more. The sky is the limit for what you can accomplish at Contractor Compliance. Like we've said above, we want you to share your ideas and really make a mark on how Contractor Compliance can morph into an even stronger solution in the market. Your voice matters!
INCLUSION. We don't believe in work-life balance. That's right, we believe in something BIGGER. We believe in WORK-LIFE INTEGRATION. Culture is a huge deal for us, and we want to hire you for more than what you contribute to your role. We want to hire you for your passions, your interests, your family and your friends. It's your environment that makes you who you are, and we want everyone at Contractor Compliance to be a part of something bigger than a job.
Interested in what you've heard? Send us your resume! We'd love to hear from you.

We are invested in making a positive difference in the world.“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.” - Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About RaceAt Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis.

Our systems are meant to consistently provide large amounts of important data, at high scale, while markets are moving quickly.
You would be part of a development team for a system that is responsible for all of the distributed components and the associated user interfaces for said risk delivery.

We encourage developers to contribute to the whole system rather than just individual components, so over time you'll have more freedom to develop in areas you are interested in. This also means individual developers have more ownership of project work across several components and programming languages.

https://jobs.isarta.com/cgi-bin/emplois/pm.cgi?action=display&login=71672&utm_source=IND


Job Overview:

Nearly all solutions we deliver consist of a .NET (C#) back-end, and a React/TypeScript front-end UI. In order to deliver a UI with which users can quickly explore and act on information, highly performant back-end services are essential.
As a Full Stack Developer at Interface 48, you will apply various software patterns to implement robust and scalable back-end systems that are as simple as possible, but no simpler. Ideally, you will also have experience implementing distributed back-end systems using an actor model. You will also use modern web technologies to implement web-based, front-end UIs that integrate with back-end systems in the most effective way possible.
You will have general knowledge of key software concepts such as: authentication, authorization, caching, and client-side state management.
You will pay particular attention to domain design in order to ensure business logic is optimally encapsulated, thereby facilitating the implementation of query and command handlers.
You will exercise sound judgement when designing front-end features to ensure a high-calibre UX, and have a keen eye for the details that matter most.
You take pride in writing code that is clean, clear and concise - the type of code you'd want to come back to in a year's time when functionality is extended.
You are capable of solving problems on your own, but also enjoy collaborating with others to find innovative solutions to unique problems.

Organized self-starter that can go it alone, and works well in a team.
Excellent critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
Versatile, flexible and responsive to changing priorities.
Innate curiosity for new software technologies and how they can be applied to your work.

Design:

Business Analysis, specifically in terms of Requirements Gathering.
Document requirements in the form of User Stories.
Describe proposed UI designs as low-fidelity mock-ups.
Possess a knack for consistent and intuitive UX design.

Development:

Develop back-end software systems by applying DDD together with CQRS and Mediator patterns, using .NET (C#).
Use DI built into the .NET Framework, or third-party DI solutions such as Autofac when more control required.
Use ORM libraries including EF Core and Dapper to interface with relational databases, most notably, Microsoft SQL Server.
Ability to read and write raw SQL queries/commands.
Implement Worker Services (e.g. Windows Services) in which to host long-running back-end services.
Integrate cloud computing services and other third-party external APIs.
Experience with NuGet package management, and basic PowerShell scripting.
Develop web applications using React.
JavaScript proficiency, including knowledge of modern features such as the spread operator, rest parameters, Promises and async/await functions.
TypeScript to ensure codebase type safety.
Integrate REST- and RPC-based HTTP APIs within JavaScript applications.
Apply Flux architecture, and specifically Redux for client-side state management.
CSS3 and JSS for styling components.
Competent with build tooling that involves NPM/Yarn and Node.js.

Extra Credit:

Core:

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or similar.

Design:

Interview individuals to assess their needs, and help lead workshops to gather requirements.
Write Options Evaluation and other Technical Reports.
Develop User Acceptance Tests that help ensure application requirements are met.

Manage development tasks using Azure DevOps.
Experience with VS Code and Visual Studio.
Familiar with Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines.
