Scarping is done using scrape.ipynb

Extracting and analysing of skills are done using analyse.ipynb

For the codes above, just install the used packages, run each cell and you can reproduce the results.

Two datasets are included here: data_ds.csv for scraped data scientists jobs, data_sd.csv for scraped software developer jobs.

Demo: 329demo.mp4

Report: report.pdf (the result figure heatmap.png is also included)

I failed to collect over 10000 postings for time limitations. My scripts all worked fine with no error.

My original plan:
Step1: scrape 11000 postings of 2 jobs and each one’s title, location, and description -- only scraped 2000
Step2: preprocess the description using NLP packages -- done
Step3: analyse, identify, extract and combine the skills part of each job -- done
Step4: show the top skills for each job title, compute the overlap between the skills of the two jobs -- done
Step5: report -- done
